#### Purpose

We wanted to simplify the way people have to do declarations.

#### Idea

Instead of paying for something you needed to pay for work and declare the invoice later on with the receipt you need to keep we simplified it
with a simple app where you don't need the receipts anymore.

The company will generate a virtual company card where the company can put money on with business rules. The employee downloads this app and
logs in with the credentials provided by the company. The employee can then pay with NFC with the app. The app then calculates who needs to pay what
first the amount will be deducted from the company card and if there is overflow then this amount will be deducted from the employee's private account.

#### Completed

This app does work with it own BE. First you need to login with credentials provided from the BE. Then the cards with business rules will be retrived from the BE.
The app really response to NFC chips and splits the amount evenly. Even the payments are being done on the BE. So almost nothing is mocked.


#### Technologies
